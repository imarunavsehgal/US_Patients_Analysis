# US_Patients_Analysis
Making a Tableau dashboard that showcases important company KPIs like sales, profit, and 
discounts was the goal. The dashboard's purpose is to let stakeholders keep an eye on company 
performance and make wise choices.

Objectives and Deliverables 
1. Design a dashboard with a size of 1250px by 750px, including five containers and a 
filter pane. 
2. Develop the following charts: 
o YTS KPIs: Displaying total sales, profit, quantity, and discount. 
o Sales: Monthly sales trends over the years. 
o Profit: Monthly profit trends over the years. 
3. Add filters for Category, Sub-Category, Region, and Segment, displaying only 
relevant values. 
4. Ensure consistent formatting, appropriate padding, and professional aesthetics.

Language: Tableau offers a data visualisation environment that doesn't need any 
programming. Utilising Tableau's formula language, computed fields and table 
computations were employed for more complex customisations. 
  
Platform: Tableau Desktop was used to build and implement the project. To guarantee 
end users could view and interact with the dashboard, it was shared via Tableau Public.
